Ability Notes:

Description Table:	0x0824FB08

Last Pre-Battle Check for ability is Trace at 0x0801B536. This would be a good
location to insert our new checks for abilities which have an immediate effect
as soon as the Pokémon enters the battle.

Last Pre-Attack Check is in the looping check... Will get more exact location 
later.

Last During Attack Check (Before it hits that is) is some stage after the
looping check when LR = 0803FD3F and R7 = 4D. Somewhere after here is a good
place to insert the new ability checks which can prevent an attack from
taking place or change who the attack hits for example.

There is a check at 0801A8BE which checks for all "after attack" effects of
abilities of the attacked Pokémon's abilities to affect the attacking Pokémon.
(which in Generation 3, fall between Ability 9 and Ability 56). This would
be where we would need to add new checks for any abilities which have
effects on the attacking Pokémon after an attack hits.

There is then a later check on your the attacking Pokémon's abilities for
abilities which prevent the ability above from having an effect on the attacking
Pokémon. This check is at 0801B034 and encompasses all abilities from 7 up to
72.

The Synchronize check is at 0801B454.
The Soundproof check is at 0801A604.
The Sand Veil check is at 0801E088.
The Water Absorb check is at 0801A6A4, with Volt Absorb shortly afterwards.
The Flash Fire check is at 0801A6B2.
The Pressure check is at 0801E2E0.
The Battle Armor check is at 0801E4FE, with Shell Armor directly afterwards.
The Thick Fat check is at 0803F03A.
The "attacked" opponent checks for Hustle, Minus, Plus, Guts and Marvel Scale
start at 0803F052. With the attacking check for Marvel Scale right after.
Random Check against FD and FE at 0801B7FC.

Suspect the following are part of the end of turn checks:

The Forecast check is at 0801B394. This is where the forme check for Burmy
would need to be inserted. And possibly some other checks.
The Swift Swim check is at 08014D34, with Chlorophyll shortly afterwards.
The Rain Dish check is at 0801A402, with Speed Boost shortly afterwards.
There is a Truant check at 0801A418, with Shed Skin shortly afterwards.

ROM Crashed at this stage XD.
